## State-space model.
## @item idx
## Vector containing the state indices in the desired order.
## Alternatively, a cell vector containing the state names
## is possible as well.  See @code{sys.stname}.  State names
## only work if they were assigned explicitly before, i.e.
## @code{sys.stname} contains no empty strings.
## Note that if certain state indices of @var{sys} are
## missing or appear multiple times in @var{idx}, these
## states will be pruned or duplicated accordingly in the
## resulting state-space model @var{retsys}.
