Face and Voice Recognition
==========================

### Abstract 
This project aims to implement face and voice recognition using Raspberry Pi device. In order to achieve our goals, we had to make our system interact with different technologies such as Bluetooth, audio recorder, tablet and camera.
Among the tools used for this project, we had to deal with OpenCV and Python for the face recognition part, GNU Octave for the voice recognition functions.
The hardware devices used for this project were the Raspberry Pi, the camera module dedicated to Raspberry Pi and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (with the Voice Recorder app).
